<p>It's a piece of cake...as the old saying goes. Just how old? Where does it come from? Eric Partridge's <em>A Dictionary of Slang and Uncomventional English</em>(Macmillan, 8th edition, 1985" tells us it refers to "something easy to handle...," while the same Partridge, in his <em>A dictionary of Catch Phrases</em> (Rountledge & Keegan and Paul, 1977) notes, "It is, was, will be something very easy to do, a 'snip'; occasioally, it's a wonderful opportunity...also something as easy to dispose of as a piece of cake"</p>
