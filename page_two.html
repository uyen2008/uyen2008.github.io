      <p>The name of Marie-Antoine (Antonin) Careme (1783-1833), master chef and baker, comes to the forefront of any history of cake baking.Because of his incredible skill and style, he elevated the baker's art to its greatest heights, though the man himself began at the most humble level; in fact, his life parallels in microcosm the history of cakes in general. For this reason, Careme is an appropriate introduction to a historical survey.</p>
